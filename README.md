# Kenjee-EDA-project
 In this project, I conducted comprehensive EDA on a Kaggle survey dataset using Pandas , Plotly , and Matplotlib , uncovering trends in demographics, coding practices, and salary disparities. I built interactive visualizations to compare education levels by role, analyze gender gaps in tech, and model salary predictions using linear regression with Statsmodels , identifying key factors like experience and role type affecting income. Value for Business: This project highlights my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets, enabling companies to optimize workforce planning, address diversity gaps, and build data-driven strategies. The regression model demonstrates skills in predictive analytics for salary benchmarking or resource allocation. Tools & Libraries: • Pandas : Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. • Plotly/Matplotlib : Interactive visualizations for trend discovery. • Statsmodels : Linear regression for salary prediction.
